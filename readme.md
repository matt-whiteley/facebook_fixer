#FacebookFixer

Annoyed of annoying people and their opinions cluttering up an otherwise perfectly usable chat client?

Install this extension to chrome to remove the main body of Facebook's website, while leaving the chat tools in place.

###Install Procedure

1. Downlaod the manifest.json and main.js files, stick them in a nice folder on their own.
2. Go to Chrome > extensions or [click here](chrome://extensions)
3. Check the "Developer Mode" checkbox at the top
4. Click "Load unpacked extension..." from the now visible options
5. Select the folder that has the files you just downloaded
6. Refresh Facebook, find it fixed!
